### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Vansh Gaikwad**, a developer & creator based in India.  
I love building things that solve real problems — from IoT devices to AI-powered web apps.

If an idea hits my mind, I usually turn it into a project, ship it fast, and jump to the next build.

My main tech stack includes **React, Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind, Java**, and **AI models**.  
I also work with **IoT, ESP32, sensors, automation, and real-time camera AI**.

I regularly practice **DSA**, and **Java** is my favorite programming language.

My favourite tools: **VS Code, Figma, GitHub, Postman**, and anything that helps me build faster.

I’ve built dozens of projects already — both hardware and software — and privately, the list is even longer.

If you want to see how I build things, stick around — more cool projects are coming soon.
